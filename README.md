## General Info

This exercise aimed, in addition to the practice of programming and shell script concepts, to encourage students to get used to linux as an important development tool, knowing its main commands, files and environment variables.

There was also an incentive for the introductory use of Git and GitHub, making use of good collaborative work practices such as handling previous conflicts of a new feature within a branch where it will be developed using the `merge` into it before doing it in the default branch (**main**), for example with a `Pull Request`.
